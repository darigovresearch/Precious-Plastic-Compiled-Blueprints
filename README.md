# Precious-Plastic-Compiled-Blueprints
Repository containing compiled blueprints for precious plastic machines for ease of use

## Introduction
This repository has taken blueprints of open source machines that recycle plastic from the [Precious plastic kit](https://github.com/ONEARMY/precious-plastic-kit) and compiled them into individual pdfs for each machine.

## Notes
Please note the modifications which have been made & where you can find updates.
1. All blueprints have been taken from the starter kit and compiled into single blueprints to make them easier to read instead of opening hundreds of individual pdf files.
2. Any updates, corrections or translations to the these compiled blueprints can be found at <a href="https://github.com/darigovresearch/Precious-Plastic-Compiled-Blueprints">https://github.com/darigovresearch/Precious-Plastic-Compiled-Blueprints</a> so do return periodically to check if you have the latest version.
